# 🌐 IoT Devices – Simple Notes

## What is IoT?

**Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to physical devices that connect to the internet to **collect, send, and receive data**.

Examples include sensors, smart appliances, wearable devices, and industrial machines.

---

## Common IoT Devices

- 📡 Sensors (temperature, humidity, motion)
    
- 💡 Smart lights
    
- 📷 Smart cameras
    
- ⌚ Wearables (smartwatches)
    
- 🏠 Smart home devices (thermostats, locks)
    
- 🚗 Vehicle tracking devices

## Basic IoT Architecture

1. **Device** – collects data
    
2. **Network** – Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa
    
3. **Gateway / Cloud** – processes & stores data
    
4. **Application** – web or mobile app

## Common IoT Protocols

- **MQTT** – lightweight, popular for IoT
    
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – simple but heavier
    
- **CoAP** – for constrained devices
    
- **AMQP** – enterprise messaging
